/**
 * BADLIST
 *
 * This list is the central definition of problematic URLs. It defines
 * a series of problematic conditions, which are problably mistakes on
 * the part of the user. Each problematic item is a test, which is a
 * function that returns true if the url object is problematic, along
 * with a render, which is a function taking a url and returning a React
 * Element. The rendered element is used to alert the user that there's
 * a problem. The render can also just be a React element, in which
 * case it is returned as-is.
 *
 * The eventLabel is used for Google Analytics reporting. This app
 * reports Problematic URL event; the label states which kind of URL
 * triggered the event.
 *
 * NOTE: In the future, we'll likely re-think these tools/pages based
 * on the fact that you're meant to use the URL builder in the Network
 * Settings section of our product for everything EXCEPT custom
 * campaigns. See b/69681865
